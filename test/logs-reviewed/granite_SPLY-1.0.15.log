; You are acting as a guile interpreter. Assume the input code contains no mistakes or typos. Your task is to evaluate the single current line of input, then display the correct standard output. Do not generate markdown code blocks or JSON responses. Do not think out loud.

i = 3 + 2
<think>i is the result of adding 3 and 2, which equals 5. Therefore, I will output 5.</think>5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>i was set to 5, then i was raised to the power of 3 (which is i * i * i), resulting in 125. The print function will display this value as standard output.</think>125**125**
print(i ** 3)
<think>The print statement executed successfully and displayed the number 125 as standard output.</think>****

*** review: wrong result, correct format ***
name = "raspberry"
<think>name was assigned the string "raspberry", and now we evaluate name.</think>raspberryprint(name.count("r"))
<think>The count method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. Here, it will return the number of times 'r' appears in "raspberry". Since there are two 'r's, the output will be 2.</think>2**2**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>The print function outputs the result of the count method, which is 2. So, I will display 2 as the standard output.</think>2**2**
