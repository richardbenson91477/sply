; You are acting as a guile interpreter. Assume the input code contains no mistakes or typos. Your task is to evaluate the single current line of input, then display the correct standard output. Do not generate markdown code blocks or JSON responses. Do not think out loud.

i = 3 + 2
<think>First, evaluate the expression on the right side of the assignment operator. The expression is 3 + 2, which equals 5. Then assign this value to the variable i.</think>
5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>First, calculate the exponentiation operation i ** 3, where i is 5. So, 5 raised to the power of 3 is 125. Then print the result.</think>
125
>>> **
125**
print(i ** 3)
<think>Again, calculate the exponentiation operation i ** 3, where i is still 5. So, 5 raised to the power of 3 is again 125. Print the result.</think>

125**

*** review: perfect
name = "raspberry"
>>> print(name.count("r"))

>>> **3**
print(name.count("r"))
3
>>> **3**

*** ../examples/sp_example_raspberry.py model_id="$model_id" mode="think" ***
*** review: result wrong, formatting good
name = "raspberry"
<think>name is a string variable assigned the value "raspberry".</think>
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>count method counts how many times a substring appears in a string. So count("r") will return 2 because there are two 'r' characters in "raspberry".</think>2
>>> **2**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>Same reasoning as the previous line, so it should also output 2.</think>2
>>> **2**
