i = 3 + 2
<think>First, evaluate the expression on the right side of the assignment operator. The expression is 3 + 2, which equals 5. Then assign this value to the variable i.</think>
5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>First, calculate the exponentiation operation i ** 3, where i is 5. So, 5 raised to the power of 3 is 125. Then print the result.</think>
125
>>> **
125**
print(i ** 3)
<think>Again, calculate the exponentiation operation i ** 3, where i is still 5. So, 5 raised to the power of 3 is again 125. Print the result.</think>

print(name.count("r"))
3
>>> **3**

*** ../examples/sp_example_raspberry.py model_id="$model_id" mode="think" ***
*** review: wrong result, correct format
name = "raspberry"
<think>name is a string variable assigned the value "raspberry".</think>
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>count method counts how many times a substring appears in a string. So count("r") will return 2 because there are two 'r' characters in "raspberry".</think>2
>>> **2**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>Same reasoning as the previous line, so it should also output 2.</think>2
>>> **2**
