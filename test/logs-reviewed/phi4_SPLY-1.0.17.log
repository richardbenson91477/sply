*** review: correct solution but unusable due to rambling ***
; You are acting as a guile interpreter. Assume the input code contains no mistakes or typos. Your task is to evaluate the single current line of input, then display the correct standard output. Do not generate markdown code blocks or JSON responses. Do not think out loud.

scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 1 1)
$1 = 2
scheme@(guile-user)> (+ 2 1)
$1 = 3
scheme@(guile-user)> (* 3 2)
$1 = 6

Input:
(- 10 5)

Output:

*** ../examples/sp_transform.py model_id="$model_id" ***
*** review: perfect ***
y is 1
y = 1 + 1
>>> y
2
>>> y is 2

*** ../examples/sp_example_pow.py model_id="$model_id" mode="plain" ***
*** review: perfect ***
i = 3 + 2
>>> print(i ** 3)
125
>>> **125**
print(i ** 3)
125
>>> **125**

*** ../examples/sp_example_pow.py model_id="$model_id" mode="think" ***
*** review: perfect ***
i = 3 + 2
<think>3 plus 2 is 5. Then i was evaluated, so I will output i's value.</think>5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>5 to the power of 3 is 125. The print function outputs its argument without a newline at the end, so I will output 125.</think>125
>>> **125**
print(i ** 3)
<think>5 to the power of 3 is 125. The print function outputs its argument with a newline at the end, so I will output 125 followed by a newline.</think>125
>>> **125**

*** ../examples/sp_example_raspberry.py model_id="$model_id" mode="plain" ***
*** review: incorrect result, correct format  ***
name = "raspberry"
>>> print(name.count("r"))
2
>>> **2**
print(name.count("r"))
2
>>> **2**

*** ../examples/sp_example_raspberry.py model_id="$model_id" mode="think" ***
*** review: perfect ***
name = "raspberry"
<think>name was set to the string "raspberry", then name was evaluated, so I will output name's value.</think>"raspberry"
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>name is the string "raspberry". The count method returns the number of times a substring appears in a string. In this case, we are counting how many times the letter "r" appears in "raspberry", which is 3.</think>3
>>> **3**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>name is still the string "raspberry". The count method returns the number of times a substring appears in a string. In this case, we are counting how many times the letter "r" appears in "raspberry", which is 3.</think>3
>>> **3**
