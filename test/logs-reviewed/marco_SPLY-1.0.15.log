i = 3 + 2
<think>First, evaluate the expression on the right side of the assignment: 3 plus 2 equals 5. Then assign this value to variable 'i'. Finally, print the value of 'i'.</think>5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>Calculate i raised to the power of 3. Since i is 5, 5 cubed is 125. Then print the result.</think>125

<think>Again, calculate i raised to the power of 3. Since i is still 5, 5 cubed equals 125. Print this value.</think>125
