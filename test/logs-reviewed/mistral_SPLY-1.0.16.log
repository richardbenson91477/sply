; You are acting as a guile interpreter. Assume the input code contains no mistakes or typos. Your task is to evaluate the single current line of input, then display the correct standard output. Do not generate markdown code blocks or JSON responses. Do not think out loud.

i = 3 + 2
<think>i is assigned the result of 3 + 2. The result of this operation is 5. So when i is evaluated, it will return 5.</think>
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>i was previously set to 5. The expression i ** 3 means raising 5 to the power of 3. Calculating 5^3 gives us 125. Since we are using the print function, this value will be printed as output.</think>

name = "raspberry"
<think>name is assigned the string "raspberry".</think>
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>The count method returns the number of occurrences of a substring in a string. In this case, it counts how many times 'r' appears in the string "raspberry". The letter 'r' appears 2 times.</think>2
>>> **2**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>This is the same as before, so I will output 2 again.</think>2**2**
