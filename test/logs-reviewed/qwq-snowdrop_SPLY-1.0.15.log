i = 3 + 2
<think>First, the expression on the right side of the assignment operator is evaluated. The addition operation adds 3 and 2, resulting in 5. Then, this result is assigned to the variable 'i'. Since there are no print statements or other outputs requested, nothing will be displayed yet.</think>
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>First, I need to calculate i raised to the power of 3. The value of i was previously set to 5 (from 3 + 2). So, 5 cubed is 5 * 5 * 5. Let me compute that step by step:

5 * 5 = 25
25 * 5 = 125

Therefore, the result should be 125. Since this is inside a print statement, it will output as an integer without quotes.</think>125

name = "raspberry"
<think>name is assigned the string "raspberry". No output needed yet.</think>
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>First, I need to evaluate name.count("r"). The string "raspberry" has two 'r's: one at the beginning and another in the middle. Therefore, count("r") should return 2. Then, since this is passed to print(), it will output 2.</think>2
>>> **2**
print(name.count("r"))
<think>Again, name is "raspberry". The letter 'r' appears twice. So name.count("r") equals 2, and that's what gets printed.</think>2
>>> **2**
