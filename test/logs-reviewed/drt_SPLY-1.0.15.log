i = 3 + 2
<think>First, I add the numbers 3 and 2 together. The result is 5. Then, I assign this sum to the variable 'i'. Finally, I evaluate 'i' and find that its value is 5.
</think>5
>>> print(i ** 3)
<think>First, I identify the value of i as 5. Next, I calculate i raised to the power of 3, which is 5^3 = 125. Finally, I use the print function to display this result, so my output is 125.

name = "raspberry"
<think>name was set to "raspberry", then name was evaluated, so I will output the string "raspberry".</think>raspberry
>>> print(name.count("r"))
<think>name is a string with the value "raspberry". The method count() is called on this string to count the number of occurrences of the character 'r'. There are 2 'r's in "raspberry", so I will output 2.</think>2
